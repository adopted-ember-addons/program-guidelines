# Program Guidelines
Sometimes an Ember addon needs a new maintainer. In order to make this a consolidated community effort, we started Adopted Ember Addons, an org where community members can find a new home for their ember addon. 

## Getting your addon adopted
- To get your addon adopted, please ping melsumner in [Ember Discord](https://discord.gg/emberjs) chat and let her know what repo you'd like to transfer. 
- Once she's aware, complete the Addon Transfer checklist (below).
- after the checklist is complete, transfer the repo to melsumner here on Github. 
- The addon will then be transferred to this org (Adopted Ember Addons). 

## Addon Transfer Checklist
These are the things that need to be updated in the addon: 
- [ ] change the package.json repository field
- [ ] if any demo URL or homepage is referenced, it should be updated. At the very least, file an issue on the repo so the adopter can fix

## Adopting an addon
Anyone can submit a pull request to help maintain an addon in this repo! It's also possible that you'd like to wear more of an official maintainer hat, and that's cool too! If you want to help maintain one of these addons, please open an issue that requests to be added as a contributor. You'll be contacted in Ember Discord (just so we know who you are!) and we'll make sure that you have 2FA set up for GitHub. and then we can add you as a contributor.
