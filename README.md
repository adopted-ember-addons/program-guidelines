# Program Guidelines
Checklist and guidelines for the Adopted Ember Addons org. 

## Getting your addon adopted
- To get your addon adopted, please ping melsumner in [Ember Discord]() chat and let her know what repo you'd like to transfer. 
- Once she's aware, complete the Addon Transfer checklist (below).
- after the checklist is complete, transfer the repo to melsumner here on Github. 
- The addon will then be transferred to this org (Adopted Ember Addons). 

## Addon Transfer Checklist
These are the things that need to be updated in the addon: 
- [ ] change the package.json repository field
- [ ] if any demo URL or homepage is referenced, it should be updated. At the very least, file an issue on the repo so the adopter can fix

## Adopting an addon
If you want to help maintain one of these addons, please open an issue that requests to be added as a contributor. You'll be contacted in Ember Discord (just so we know who you are!) and then we can add you as a contributor.
